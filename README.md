# A Sentiment Analysis Web App
## Using PyTorch and SageMaker

_Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program | Deployment_

---

This project uses SageMaker to construct a complete project from end to end. Our goal will be to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.

Note: In order to run this will require deploying a Sagemaker instance, which can be done using the notebook. The URL of the Sagemaker instance will have to be updated in the relevant AWS Lambda function.
