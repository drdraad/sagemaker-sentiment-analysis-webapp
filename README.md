# A Sentiment Analysis Web App
## Using PyTorch and SageMaker

_Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program | Deployment_

---

This project uses SageMaker to construct a complete project from end to end. Our goal will be to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.
